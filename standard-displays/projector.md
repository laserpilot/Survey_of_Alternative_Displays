# Projector

![](../.gitbook/assets/1hjtm-jwv8AAjHZRufVDueA.jpeg)



I have covered projectors in depth in [another article](https://github.com/laserpilot/Guide\_To\_Projectors\_For\_Interactive\_Installations/blob/master/Guide%20to%20Projectors%20for%20Interactive%20Installations.md) so I won’t go into detail with them here. It is important to remember that they are not much more than a fancy implementation of a light source, an imaging element and a lens. They are best for darker environments, but they tend to be the most economical choice for large scale imagery. It is also easier to blend multiple projectors together more seamlessly.
