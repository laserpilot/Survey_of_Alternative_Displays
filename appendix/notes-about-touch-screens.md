# Notes about Touch Screens

Since touchscreen technology is adjacent to specialized displays, I figured it would be good to have a brief section here that covered a few different touch screen technologies.

Types:

* PCAP/Projected Capacitance
* Infrared
* Resistive
* Surface Acoustic Waves
* Surface Capacitive
* LIDAR
* Object/Marker recognition on screens
* Frustrated Total Internal Reflection + Vision (e.g. https://sethsandler.com/multitouch/ftir/)
